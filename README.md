## How to publish the project

Follow the steps below:

- `npm login`
- `npm build`
- `npm publish` or `npm publish --scope=<organization_name>`
- `npm unpublish --scope=<organization_name> --force`

> `--scope` is only necessary if the package name in the `package.json` file does not have the company name as a prefix. Always the company name must be with the "@-2 at the beginning and a separator "/" at the end.

```json
{
  "name": "@viamericas/demo-react-to-npm-package"
}
```

## Validate weight of package

You can run the next commands to see the result of the bundle :

- `npm run build:debug`
- `npm run analizedependences`

> Need to have installed source-map-explorer globally.

```bash
npm install -g source-map-explorer
```
